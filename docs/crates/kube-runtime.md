# kube-runtime

`kube-runtime` is the runtime crate with the highest level abstractions.
It is re-exported from [[kube]] under `kube::runtime`.

!!! warning "No need to depend on this directly"

    The standard way to get runtime + client features is to depend on `kube` with the additional `runtime` feature, and access `kube::runtime`. This way you avoid multiple entries in `Cargo.toml` which can cause version mismatches.

This crate has the most extensive documentation on [docs.rs/kube/runtime](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/index.html).
