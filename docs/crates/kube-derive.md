# kube-derive

`kube-derive` is a procedural macro crate with helpers for managing Custom Resource Definitions. The macros are re-exported from [[kube]].

!!! warning "No need to depend on this directly"

    The standard way to get derive features is to depend on `kube` with the additional `derive` feature, and access `kube::CustomResource`. This way you avoid multiple entries in `Cargo.toml` which can cause version mismatches.

The macros exported are heavily documented on:

- [docs.rs/kube/CustomResource](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/derive.CustomResource.html)

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[kube]: kube "kube"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
