# kube-core

`kube-core` is the core crate with the lowest level abstractions.
It is re-exported from [[kube]] under `kube::core`.


!!! warning "No need to depend on this directly"

    The standard way to get only core features is to depend on `kube` with `default-features = false` as this will bring in the minimal `kube`. If you need a client later, you don't then need to change your import paths.

This crate has the most extensive documentation on [docs.rs/kube/core](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/index.html).

## Contains

Core traits and types necessary for interacting with the Kubernetes API.
This crate is the rust counterpart to [kubernetes/apimachinery](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery).
