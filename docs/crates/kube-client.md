# kube-client

`kube-client` is the client crate with config and client abstractions.
It is re-exported from [[kube]] under the `kube::client` and `kube::config` modules.

!!! warning "No need to depend on this directly"

    The standard way to get only client + core features is to depend on `kube` with its default features. If you need a runtime or the proc-macro later, you don't then need to change your import paths.

This crate has the most extensive documentation on

- [docs.rs/kube/config](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/config/index.html)
