# Application WIP

The controller **application** watches **object** changes and forwards the main **object** to the reconciler.

This doc is a **WIP**.

plan:

- standard build setup (cargo + ci)
- main controller glue (Controller invocation, linking to further topics)
- containerising (with musl or distroless)
