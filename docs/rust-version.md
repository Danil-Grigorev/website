# Rust Version

Builds on CI always run against the most stable rust version, but we also support stable versions down to a specified **Minimum Supported Rust Version** (MSRV).

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

The MSRV is the version listed in the badge at the [top of the main README](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs#kube-rs), and it is verified as buildable as part of the main CI action.

> [![Rust 1.XX](https://img.shields.io/badge/MSRV-1.XX-dea584.svg)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/)

We have no official policy on when bumps occur, but we **try** to let the MSRV trail one or two stable versions behind the latest stable as a convenience to users downstream.

## For maintainers: Bumping the MSRV

Bumping the MSRV is done either as:

- a response to a PR that brings in a dependency with a higher MSRV
- an explicit choice to get new rust features

Performing the change requires developer [[tools]], and is done by running `just bump-msrv 1.60.0` to bump the all the `Cargo.toml` files:

```diff
-rust-version = "1.56.0"
+rust-version = "1.60.0"
```

as well as the badge plus devcontainer. If the bump is sufficient, CI will verify that the specified MSRV works with the current dependencies and feature usage before it can be merged.

**NB**: An MSRV change **must have** the `changelog-change` label so that it is sufficiently highlighted in our [[changelog]].

## For contributors: Nightly tooling

Due to some [limitations in stable `rustdoc` and `rustfmt`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/707), we use the `nightly` toolchain for auto-formatting and documentation.

**NB**: This is contributor quirk only. All crates will **always build** with the **stable** toolchain.

CI always runs documentation and formatting builds against the latest `nightly`, but in general, the relevant features change very infrequently, so it's generally safe to rely on older nightly builds unless CI complains.

```sh
rustup update nightly
```
